# Ultrasonic Distance Meter with Arduino with custom 7 segment display

## Project Description  
This project, *Ultrasonic Distance Meter with Arduino*, demonstrates how to use an Arduino microcontroller to measure distances with an ultrasonic sensor and display the results on a 7-segment display. The ultrasonic sensor calculates distances by emitting sound waves and measuring the time it takes for the echo to return. The program processes the data to determine distance values in meters, rounding them to the nearest integer, and lights up corresponding segments on the display to represent values from 0 to 9.  

The project serves as an excellent introduction to interfacing hardware components such as sensors and displays with Arduino. It highlights essential concepts, including pulse measurement, data processing, and visualization on a 7-segment display.
